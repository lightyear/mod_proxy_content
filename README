mod_proxy_content is a fork of mod_proxy_html intended for use with modern
web applications. It is based on mod_proxy_html 3.0.1, plus bug fixes made
through version 3.1.2. Development was funded by the Council of Better
Business Bureaus. It has been in production use at BBB since early 2009.

The main drawback of mod_proxy_html for modern web applications is that it
does not try to parse anything except HTML, though it is not unusual to
reference URLs within the application in both Javascript and CSS files.
While it is possible to force mod_proxy_html to parse these files and
write regular expressions that safely remap the URLs, it is tedious and
error-prone. mod_proxy_content solves this problem by doing the hard work
for you.

Configuration is the same as for mod_proxy_html, though mod_proxy_content
will process Javascript and CSS files without using PROXY_HTML_FORCE. It
uses the same mappings from ProxyHTMLURLMap directives, supplemented with
regular expressions that match only relevant parts of each type of content.

Here is a simple configuration, added to the sample proxy_html.conf, that
serves the content from two private servers through a single public server.

    # foo.example.com -> www.example.com/foo/
    ProxyPass /foo/ http://foo.example.com/
    ProxyPassReverse /foo/ http://foo.example.com/
    ProxyHTMLURLMap http://foo.example.com /foo

    # bar.example.com -> www.example.com/bar/
    ProxyPass /bar/ http://bar.example.com/
    ProxyPassReverse /bar/ http://bar.example.com/
    ProxyHTMLURLMap http://bar.example.com /bar

    <LocationMatch (?i)^/foo/>
        ProxyPassReverse /
        SetOutputFilter proxy-content
        RequestHeader unset Accept-Encoding
        ProxyHTMLURLMap / /foo/
    </LocationMatch>

    <LocationMatch (?i)^/bar/>
        ProxyPassReverse /
        SetOutputFilter proxy-content
        RequestHeader unset Accept-Encoding
        ProxyHTMLURLMap / /bar/
    </LocationMatch>

Sometimes, certain Javascript files will generate false hits and remapping
these files will break your web application. You can exclude certain files
from URL remapping:

    <Location ~ /frame.js$>
        ProxyHTMLFixups reset
    </Location>


The rest of this file is the original README that shipped with
mod_proxy_html 3.1. WebThing DOES NOT support mod_proxy_content, though
the original documentation is a useful resource to understanding reverse
proxies and how to configure them.

UPGRADING: IMPORTANT NOTE

If you are upgrading from mod_proxy_html 2.x (or 1.x), you will need
some new configuration.  You can Include proxy_html.conf from this
bundle in your httpd.conf (or apache.conf) to use Version 3 as a
drop-in replacement for Version 2.


WINDOWS USERS:

You may need to install some prerequisite libraries before you can
load mod_proxy_html into apache.  If you don't already have them,
see the README at
